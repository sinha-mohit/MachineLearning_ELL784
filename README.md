## ➔ Background Subtraction : 
Using the idea of Motion Segmentation and Sequential
labeling Algorithm, designed a model which separates foreground and background
in a running video with help of Gaussian Mixture Model.
## ➔ Face recognition using PCA and LDA techniques : 
Faces Recognition using
PCA(Eigen Faces) and LDA(Fisher Faces) techniques were implemented from
scratch in Python and its performance according to varying lighting conditions and
with different face emotions were studied.
